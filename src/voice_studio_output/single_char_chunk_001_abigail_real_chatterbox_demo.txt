Text: You rub your eyes and take a slow sip. It’s warm, thick, and slightly sour, but it softens the monotony. Here in the monastery scriptorium, hours blend together in a rhythmic shuffle of quills and whispers. The candle beside you flickers. Your neighbor scratches a line, sighs audibly, then mumbles something about Saint Jerome. It’s quiet again. In the medieval world, you are a scribe—a professional book-copyist—and you matter more than you think.
